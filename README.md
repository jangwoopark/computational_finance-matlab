### Projects
1.1
- Generate 10,000 Uniformly distributed random numbers on [0,1] and plot the histogram of
them using LGM method;
- Now use built-in functions of Matlab to do the same thing.
- Compare the histograms of the above random number sequences.
1.2
- Generate 10,000 random numbers with the following distribution:
    | -1 with probability 0.3
X = |  0 with probability 0.5
    |  1 with probability 0.2
- Draw the histogram and the empirical distribution function by using the 10,000 numbers generated.
